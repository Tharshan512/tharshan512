            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My name is Tharshan Manimohan and I am a second-year student at Ontario Tech University. Currently, I am studying Networking and IT Security. I really enjoy networking with different kinds of people, as I find it extremely important for various reasons, such as in college, university, or the workplace, where you can learn many new things.</p>

            <h2>My Goals</h2>
            <p>I have completed my advanced diploma in Biomedical Engineering Technology at Centennial College. This is my second program, and I plan to try working both jobs to see which one I prefer. Thereâ€™s even a chance I might attempt to do both jobs simultaneously.</p>
